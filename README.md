Alyra final project

I created a platform allowing an ufc fan, to enter in the skin of a referee.
During each fight, a spectator will be able to count the number of hits received by each fighter, the winner of each round and finally of the fight.

At the end, the spectator who has scored a number of hits similar (or the closest), of the tally of the referees, will earn an NFT. 
This token, will giving him/her access to privileges. For example, to meet the fighters, to participate in a training session, to have a full access to the preparation of the athletes during 1 week, to be in a dressing room at the beginning of a fight and why not, to be totally taken care of during a main event.

Few rules:  
✔️ A user need to be registered to participate to a fight

✔️ A user should pay a fee of 0.059 eth to participate to one fight

✔️ A fight could have 3 to 5 rounds

✔️ Each round will last 5 mins

✔️ You will be able to count each hit received by each fighter

✔️ After each round, you will submit your round's result

✔️ Data whose have been submitted can be modified
